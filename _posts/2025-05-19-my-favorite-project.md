# My Favorite Student Projects of 2025

In a project-based data science class, I've gotten student work that has delighted me, confused me, horrified me, and sparked genuine curiosity in me.  Here are my favorite Data Science project ideas from the 2025 school year.  

## Project #1 - Dunkin Donuts 

A few months into the school year, my student discovered [this article](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/09/17/business/dunkin-prices-cheap-reddit-tufts-dunkinscout/) from the Boston Globe (sorry about the paywall).  In essence, a hobbyist and student at Tufts named Jack Burton created a quick lookup tool for various Dunkin items to compare the price of that item across several locations (or find the location where that item is cheapest).  My student, herself an admitted Dunkin addict, wanted to expand on this idea and create maps of the variation in Iced Coffee prices around the country.  

Mr. Burton, helpfully, provided his source code on [his github page](https://github.com/jack898/dunkinScout), so we found out how to use the Dunkin API to scrape prices from Dunkin location data, and my student took it from there to create maps, visualizations, and descriptions of Dunkin pricing around the country, around Boston, etc.  

I loved this project from conception to follow-through.  First, it was clearly *possible*, which can be a challenge for students.  Many times, students want to do the impossible with their data projects:  create a perfect bracket, solve a systemic issue of injustice, predict the next Oscar winners - all terrific goals that inevitably lead to disappointment when students discover the deep complexity of the data (or lack thereof).  Second, this project was *ambitious* in non-obvious ways.  We had never covered working with location data.  My student needed to learn new skills that built on the ones covered in class.  And third, this project was *engaging*.  I've been criticized in the past for allowing students to pursue projects that feel "silly."  I would posit that this student will gain more skills by pursuing a project she really wanted to do, rather than dive into a rubric and check boxes.  She will have many opportunities to use those same skills in ways that have larger impacts, and this exploration of Dunkin prices may have been her doorway into that reality.
